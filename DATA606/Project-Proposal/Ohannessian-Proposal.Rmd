### Data Preparation

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(rworldmap)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)
library(plotly)
```

<div class="alert alert-success">
<b><u>City of Chicago - Locations of Array of Things sensor nodes</u></b><br>
Listing an overview of projects and plans that some went live and some are still planned and locating sensors on the map.
</div>

```{r}
array_of_things_locations_data<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hovig/MSDS_CUNY/master/DATA606/Project-Proposal/array-of-things-locations-1.csv")

status_of_things<-array_of_things_locations_data %>% 
                    group_by(Status) %>%
                    summarise(count=n())

dat <- data.frame(
    status = factor(status_of_things$Status, levels=status_of_things$Status),
    count = status_of_things$count
)

df<-round(data.frame(
  x = jitter(array_of_things_locations_data$Longitude, amount = .3),
  y = jitter(array_of_things_locations_data$Latitude, amount = .3)), 
  digits = 2)
```


### Research question 

**You should phrase your research question in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for.**

Whats the status of plans for the Array of Things project done by the City of Chicago? And where the sensors are located?


### Cases 

**What are the cases, and how many are there?**

Each case represents a sensor. There are `r nrow(array_of_things_locations_data)` observations in the given data set.


### Data collection 

**Describe the method of data collection.**

- For more information on the Array of Things project, see https://arrayofthings.github.io.
- Last updated at https://data.cityofchicago.org/ : 2018-02-27


### Type of study 

**What type of study is this (observational/experiment)?**

This is an observational study.


### Data Source 

**If you collected the data, state self-collected. If not, provide a citation/link.**

<u>The data is collected by the City of Chicago and found here for more relevance:</u>

- Source: https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/6rq2-yx28


### Response 

**What is the response variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?**

The response variable is status and is categrical.


### Explanatory 

**What is the explanatory variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorival)?**

The explanatory variables are the count and the geolocations and are numerical.


### Relevant summary statistics 

**Provide summary statistics relevant to your research question. For example, if youâ€™re comparing means across groups provide means, SDs, sample sizes of each group. This step requires the use of R, hence a code chunk is provided below. Insert more code chunks as needed.**


```{r}
glimpse(array_of_things_locations_data)
```

```{r}
kable(status_of_things)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=dat, aes(x=status, y=count, fill=time)) + 
    geom_bar(colour="black", fill="#DD8888", width=.8, stat="identity") + 
    guides(fill=FALSE) +
    xlab("Status type") + ylab("Status count per type") +
    ggtitle("Chicago's planning status")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
map<-get_googlemap('chicago', markers = df, path = df, scale = 2)
```

```{r}
ggmap(map, extent = 'device')
```
