### 8.2

##### 8.2  Baby  weights,  Part  II. Exercise  8.1  introduces  a  data  set  on  birth  weight  of  babies. Another variable we consider is parity, which is 0 if the child is the first born, and 1 otherwise. The summary table below shows the results of a linear regression model for predicting the average birth weight of babies, measured in ounces, from parity.

##### (a)  Write the equation of the regression line.
##### (b)  Interpret the slope in this context, and calculate the predicted birth weight of first borns and others.
##### (c)  Is there a statistically significant relationship between the average birth weight and parity?
<hr>


(a) Linear regression equation: $y = b_0 + b_1 \times parity = 120.07 - 1.93 \times x$

(b)
```
if x increases 
  y decreases
else if x decreases
  y increases
```
* For firstborns, consider x=0: y = 120.07 - 1.93 * 0 = `r 120.07 - (1.93 * 0)`<br>
* For non-firstborns, consider x=1: y = 120.07 - 1.93 * 1 = `r 120.07 - (1.93 * 1)`

(c) Let's consider the following hypotheses:<br>
$H_0$: $b_1$ = 0<br>
$H_1$: $b_1$ != 0

Given the $Pr_{parity}$ = 0.1052 in the table, we can reject $H_0$ since $Pr_{parity}$ > 0.05.

It doesn't seem that the average birth weight and parity have a relationship.

### 8.4

##### 8.4  Absenteeism, Part I.
Researchers interested in the relationship between absenteeism from
school and certain demographic characteristics of children collected data from 146 randomly sam-
pled students in rural New South Wales, Australia, in a particular school year.  Below are three
observations from this data set.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hovig/MSDS_CUNY/master/DATA606/hw8/8.4a.png" width="250" height="150">

The summary table below shows the results of a linear regression model for predicting the average
number of days absent based on ethnic background (eth:  0 - aboriginal, 1 - not aboriginal), sex(sex:  0 - female, 1 - male), and learner status (lrn:  0 - average learner, 1 - slow learner).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hovig/MSDS_CUNY/master/DATA606/hw8/8.4b.png" width="350" height="250">

##### (a)  Write the equation of the regression line.
##### (b)  Interpret each one of the slopes in this context.
##### (c)  Calculate the residual for the first observation in the data set:  a student who is aboriginal, male, a slow learner, and missed 2 days of school.
##### (d)  The variance of the residuals is 240.57, and the variance of the number of absent days for all students in the data set is 264.17.  Calculate the R^2 and the adjusted R^2.  Note that there are 146 observations in the data set
<hr>


(a) Linear regression equation: $y = b_0 + b_1 * eth + b_2 * sex + b_3 * lrn = 18.93 - 9.11 * x_1 + 3.10 * x_2 + 2.15 * x_3$

(b) 
<u>eth</u>: "ethnic" - if ethnic is not aboriginal, the average # of absent days increases by 9.11<br>
<u>sex</u>: "sex" - if sex is male, the average # of absent days increases by 3.1<br>
<u>lrn</u>: "learner" - if learner is slow learner, the average # of absent days increases by 2.15

(c) 
<br><u>Given</u>:<br> 
$y_{missed}$ = 2<br>
$x_1$ = 0 (aboriginal = 0 | not-aboriginal = 1)<br>
$x_2$ = 1 (female = 0 | male = 1)<br>
$x_3$ = 1 (average-learner = 0 | slow-learner = 1)

y = 18.93 - 9.11 * x_1 + 3.10 * x_2 + 2.15 * x_3<br>
y = 18.93 - 9.11 * 0 + 3.10 * 1 + 2.15 * 1<br>
y = `r 18.93 - 9.11 * 0 + 3.10 * 1 + 2.15 * 1`
  
residual = $y_{missed}$ - y = 2 - `r 18.93 - 9.11 * 0 + 3.10 * 1 + 2.15 * 1` = `r 2 + (18.93 - 9.11 * 0 + 3.10 * 1 + 2.15 * 1)`

(d) 
<br><u>Given</u>:<br> 
Var(residual) = 240.57<br> 
Var(y_i) = 264.17<br> 
n = 146<br>
k = total_coefficents - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 

$R^2$ = $1 - \frac{Var(residual)}{Var(y_i)}$<br>
$R^2$ = $1 - \frac{240.57}{264.17}$<br>
$R^2$ = `r 1 - (240.57/264.17)`

adjusted:<br>
$R^2_{adj}$ = $R^2 \times \frac{n-1}{n-k-1}$<br>
$R^2_{adj}$ = `r 1 - (240.57/264.17)` * `r (146-1) / (146-3-1)`<br>
$R^2_{adj}$ = `r 1 - ((240.57/264.17) * ((146-1) / (146-3-1)))`

### 8.8

##### 8.8  Absenteeism, Part II. Exercise 8.4 considers a model that predicts the number of days absent using three predictors:  ethnic background (eth),  gender (sex),  and learner status (lrn). The table below shows the adjusted R-squared for the model as well as adjusted R-squared values for all models we evaluate in the first step of the backwards elimination process.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hovig/MSDS_CUNY/master/DATA606/hw8/8.8.png" width="350" height="250">

##### Which, if any, variable should be removed from the model first?
<hr>

```{r}
library(knitr)
Model<-c("Full_model","No_ethnicity","No_sex","No_learner_status")
Adjusted_R_squared<-c(0.0701,-0.0033,0.0676,0.0723)

df<-data.frame(Model,Adjusted_R_squared)

kable(df[rev(order(df$Adjusted_R_squared)),])
```

* We notice that 3 out of 4 models have their $R^2$ between 6.76% and 7.23%: <b>$6.76$% < $R^2$ < $7.23$%</b> and 1 around 0.33%.

* Therefore, we can conclude from the reversed sorted list that "No learner status" model has the highest $R^2_{adj}$ value that should be removed for better $R^2$ results.




### 8.16

##### 8.16  Challenger disaster, Part I. On January 28, 1986, a routine launch was anticipated for the Challenger space shuttle.  Seventy-three seconds into the flight, disaster happened:  the shuttle broke  apart,  killing  all  seven  crew  members  on  board.   An  investigation  into  the  cause  of  the disaster focused on a critical seal called an O-ring, and it is believed that damage to these O-rings during a shuttle launch may be related to the ambient temperature during the launch.  The table below summarizes observational data on O-rings for 23 shuttle missions, where the mission order is based on the temperature at the time of the launch. *Temp* gives the temperature in Fahrenheit, *Damaged* represents the number of damaged O-rings, and *Undamaged* represents the number of O-rings that were not damaged.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hovig/MSDS_CUNY/master/DATA606/hw8/8.16a.png" width="350" height="250">

##### (a)  Each column of the table above represents a different shuttle mission.  Examine these data and  describe  what  you  observe  with  respect  to  the  relationship  between  temperatures  and damaged O-rings.
##### (b)  Failures  have  been  coded  as  1  for  a  damaged  O-ring  and  0  for  an  undamaged  O-ring,  and a logistic regression model was fit to these data.  A summary of this model is given below. Describe the key components of this summary table in words.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hovig/MSDS_CUNY/master/DATA606/hw8/8.16b.png" width="350" height="250">

##### (c)  Write out the logistic model using the point estimates of the model parameters.
##### (d)  Based on the model, do you think concerns regarding O-rings are justified?  Explain.
<hr>


(a)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
Temperature <- c(53,57,58,63,66,67,67,67,68,69,70,70,70,70,72,73,75,75,76,76,78,79,81)
Damaged <- c(5,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0)
qplot(x = Temperature, y = factor(Damaged), geom = "point") + 
  geom_jitter(height = 0.4, alpha = 0.5)
```

By examining the data and looking at the scatterplot, we see that the temperature is behaving as the predictor of the damaged O-rings. Results are better when the temperature is above 65 degrees and no failures above 75 degrees.

(b)

<u>Temperature</u>: if temperature is increases, O-rings damages will decrease by 0.2162. With a p-value of 0.

(c)

$y = log(\frac{p_i}{1 - p_i}) = b_0 + b_1 \times Temperature$

y = 11.6630 - 0.2162 * Temperature

(d) From our observations from above, we found that the temperature is the predictor of damaged O-rings. Low temperatures will cause damages and high temperatures will lower to null these damages. With this relationship between the temperature and the damages, we validate and justify our concerns in regards the O-rings.




### 8.18

##### 8.18  Challenger disaster, Part II. Exercise 8.16 introduced us to O-rings that were identified as a plausible explanation for the breakup of the Challenger space shuttle 73 seconds into takeoff in 1986.  The investigation found that the ambient temperature at the time of the shuttle launch was closely related to the damage of O-rings, which are a critical component of the shuttle.  See this earlier exercise if you would like to browse the original data.

##### (a)  The data provided in the previous exercise are shown in the plot.  The logistic model fit to these data may be written as

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hovig/MSDS_CUNY/master/DATA606/hw8/8.18b.png" width="350" height="250">

##### where  p is  the  model-estimated  probability  that  an  O-ring  will  become  damaged.   Use  the model to calculate the probability that an O-ring will become damaged at each of the following ambient temperatures:  51, 53, and 55 degrees Fahrenheit.  The model-estimated probabilities for several additional ambient temperatures are provided below, where subscripts indicate the temperature:

##### (b)  Add the model-estimated probabilities from part (a) on the plot, then connect these dots using a smooth curve to represent the model-estimated probabilities.
##### (c)  Describe any concerns you may have regarding applying logistic regression in this application, and note any assumptions that are required to accept the modelâ€™s validity.
<hr>

(a)
<br><u>Formula:</u><br>
$log(\frac{p}{1 - p}) = 11.6630 - 0.2162 \times Temperature$
<br>=> $p = \frac{e^{11.6630 - 0.2162 \times Temperature}}{1 + e^{11.6630 - 0.2162 \times Temperature}}$

$p_{51}$ = `r exp(11.6630 - (0.2162 * 51))/(1 + exp(11.6630 - (0.2162 * 51)))` = `r round(exp(11.6630 - (0.2162 * 51))/(1 + exp(11.6630 - (0.2162 * 51))) * 100, 2)` %<br>
$p_{53}$ = `r exp(11.6630 - (0.2162 * 53))/(1 + exp(11.6630 - (0.2162 * 53)))` = `r round(exp(11.6630 - (0.2162 * 53))/(1 + exp(11.6630 - (0.2162 * 53))) * 100, 2)` %<br>
$p_{55}$ = `r exp(11.6630 - (0.2162 * 55))/(1 + exp(11.6630 - (0.2162 * 55)))` = `r round(exp(11.6630 - (0.2162 * 55))/(1 + exp(11.6630 - (0.2162 * 55))) * 100, 2)` %

(b)
```{r}
Temperature <- c(51,53,55,57,59,61,63,65,67,69,71)
Model_estimated_probabilities <- c(0.654,0.551,0.443,0.341,0.251,0.179,0.124,0.084,0.056,0.037,0.024)
qplot(x = Temperature, y = Model_estimated_probabilities, geom = "point") + 
  stat_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = "binomial"), se = FALSE)
```

(c) 

* It's difficult to check without grouping the data 
* Additional computing may be needed like using the empirical logit function
* The fitted logistic curve in the plot provides a better understanding about the fit 
* The shuttle missions were selected at random
